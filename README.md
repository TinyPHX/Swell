## Motivation

Swell was started as a way to add water with float physics to a Unity project without attempting to control the look of the water. Swell works great with most shaders but also looks just fine with the Unity standard shader. It's the perfect tool to get your water to feel and behave how you want before spending time getting the look correct.
